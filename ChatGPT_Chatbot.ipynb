    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This course covers best practices for building a complex application using the ChatGPT API.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We use the running example of building an end-to-end customer service assistant that chains multiple calls to an LLM, using different instructions depending on the output of the previous call, and sometimes even incorporating external information sources.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow:  \n",
    "1. First, we evaluate the user’s input to ensure it does not contain problematic content or hateful speech.  \n",
    "2. Next, the system processes the input and identifies the type of query (complaint, product info, etc.).  \n",
    "3. Once the system has established that it is a product inquiry, it retrieves relevant information about the product and generates an appropriate response using the LLM.  \n",
    "4. Finally, the output is checked to ensure it is not problematic (such as inaccurate or inappropriate content).  \n",
    "\n",
    "An AI application often requires multiple internal steps that are invisible to the end user. Typically, the user’s input must be sequentially processed across these steps to produce the final output shown to the user.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As we build more complex systems using LLMs, we also want to continuously improve them over time by applying different evaluation methods.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, this course covers how to build a complex, multi-step application and how to set it up for ongoing maintenance and improvement.  \n",

    "### Overview of How LLMs Work:\n",
    "\n",
    "- LLMs attempt to generate likely completion words given a sentence.  \n",
    "- The core building block for training LLMs is supervised learning. In supervised learning, a computer learns an input → output mapping (x → y) using labeled training data.  \n",
    "<center>\n",
    "  <img src=\"images/supervised_learning.png\"/>\n",
    "</center>  \n",
    "- With a large training set containing hundreds of billions (or more) words, a massive dataset is created to repeatedly train the LLM to predict the next word.  \n",
    "<center>\n",
    "  <img src=\"images/prediction.png\"/>\n",
    "</center>  \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, there are broadly two major types of LLMs: **Base LLMs** and **Instruction-Tuned LLMs**.  \n",
    "<center>\n",
    "  <img src=\"images/llm_types.png\"/>\n",
    "</center>  \n",
    "\n",
    "Training a base LLM can take months, whereas converting a base LLM into an instruction-tuned LLM can be done in days, using a much more modest dataset size and compute resources.  "

    "\n",
    "Split complex tasks into a series of simple sub-tasks by chaining multiple prompts together.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Why use chaining instead of one long prompt?  \n",
    "- One long, complicated prompt makes it difficult for the LLM to keep track of everything.  \n",
    "- Chaining allows solving complex problems in stages, ensuring correct processing before moving on.  \n",
    "- Easier to debug errors or include a human-in-the-loop for specific steps.  \n",
    "- Longer prompts with more tokens take more time (and money) to run.  \n",
    "- External tools (web services, databases, etc.) can be used at certain points in the workflow.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another Analogy: This is similar to the difference between spaghetti code (everything in one long file) and modular programming. Spaghetti code is harder to debug and its logic is more difficult to follow.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:  \n",
    "- Chaining prompts is powerful when you can maintain the state of the system at any given point and take different actions depending on that state. \n",
    "- Each sub-task includes only the instructions required for that state, making the system easier to manage, ensuring the model has the necessary information, and reducing the chance of errors.\n",
    "However, this approach may be unnecessary or overly complex for very simple tasks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**To Summarize:** instead of describing an entire complex workflow in one long prompt, it is often better to keep track of the state externally and inject only the relevant instructions as needed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**What makes a problem complex?**  \n",
    "A problem is complex if it involves many different instructions, where potentially all of them could apply in any given situation. In such cases, it becomes difficult for the model to reason about what to do.  "
